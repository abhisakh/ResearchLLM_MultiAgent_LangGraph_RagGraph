## 🧠 ResearchState (Shared Workflow State)

ResearchState is the central shared memory used by all agents in the LangGraph workflow.
Each agent reads from and writes to this state to coordinate planning, tool execution, retrieval, synthesis, and evaluation.

It is implemented as a TypedDict to provide structure, clarity, and type safety.

### 🔹 State Categories
The state is logically grouped into six categories:

**1️⃣ User Input & Planning**

| Field            | Description                                             |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `user_query`     | Original user input                                     |
| `semantic_query` | Cleaned and normalized query                            |
| `primary_intent` | Classified intent (e.g., material, biomedical, general) |
| `execution_plan` | High-level plan generated by the Planning Agent         |

**2️⃣ Constraints & Query Structure**

| Field                | Description                                                              |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `system_constraints` | Stable constraints extracted from intent (e.g., time range, topic scope) |
| `material_elements`  | Merged list of constraints and extracted elements                        |
| `api_search_term`    | Canonical search term for structured APIs                                |
| `tiered_queries`     | Tool-specific strict / moderate / broad queries                          |
| `active_tools`       | Tools selected for execution                                             |

**3️⃣ Tool Execution & Retrieval**

| Field           | Description                           |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `raw_tool_data` | Aggregated raw outputs from all tools |
| `references`    | Collected citations and sources       |

**4️⃣ RAG Pipeline**

| Field              | Description                         |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| `full_text_chunks` | Chunked and extracted document text |
| `filtered_context` | Final context passed to synthesis   |
| `rag_complete`     | Indicates RAG pipeline completion   |

**5️⃣ Synthesis & Evaluation**

| Field               | Description                         |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `final_report`      | Generated research report           |
| `report_generated`  | Indicates synthesis completion      |
| `needs_refinement`  | Evaluation decision flag            |
| `refinement_reason` | Feedback explaining refinement need |

**6️⃣ Control & Routing**

| Field         | Description                         |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `is_refining` | Indicates refinement loop is active |
| `next`        | Routing key used by the Supervisor  |

### 🔁 State Lifecycle

1. Supervisor initializes state
2. Planning agents progressively enrich it
3. Tool agents append raw data
4. RAG agents filter and compress context
5. Synthesis writes the final report
6. Evaluation decides termination or refinement

The state persists across refinement loops, allowing iterative improvement without data loss.

## 🧠 LangGraph Architecture Overview
**graph.py**
This project implements a Supervisor-driven, multi-agent research workflow using LangGraph.
The system is designed as a state machine that coordinates planning, tool execution, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), synthesis, and evaluation with optional refinement loops.

### 🧩 Core Concept
**1.** Shared State (ResearchState)
- All agents operate on a shared memory object called ResearchState.
- Each agent reads from and writes to this state
- Routing decisions are based entirely on state values
- This makes execution transparent, debuggable, and reproducible


**2.** Nodes (Agents)

Each node in the graph is an agent that performs a single responsibility:
| Agent                | Responsibility                                   |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| SupervisorAgent      | Controls execution flow and refinement loops     |
| CleanQueryAgent      | Normalizes and cleans user input                 |
| IntentAgent          | Identifies primary intent and constraints        |
| PlanningAgent        | Creates a high-level execution plan              |
| QueryGenerationAgent | Builds structured tool queries                   |
| Tool Agents          | Execute external searches (PubMed, Arxiv, etc.)  |
| RetrievalAgent       | Aggregates tool outputs                          |
| RAGAgent             | Filters and chunks relevant context              |
| SynthesisAgent       | Produces the final report                        |
| EvaluationAgent      | Evaluates output quality and triggers refinement |


## 🚦 Routing & Control Logic

The graph uses conditional edges (routers) to dynamically control execution.
**route_from_supervisor**
Determines where execution begins or resumes.
- Reads state["next_node"]
- Routes to:
  1. clean_query_agent (fresh run)
  2. rag_filter (refinement loop)

**route_to_tools**
Determines which tool to start with after query generation.
- Reads state["active_tools"]
- Returns the first eligible tool node
- Only one tool is selected at this stage

**route_next_tool** (Tool Loop Controller)
- Controls sequential tool execution.
- Receives:(input arguments)
  - The tool that just executed
  - The shared state
  - Uses a fixed tool order:
```python
pubmed → arxiv → openalex → materials → web
```
- Routes to:
  - The next enabled tool, OR
  - retrieve_data when tool execution is complete
- This ensures:
  - Deterministic ordering
  - No repeated tools
  - No infinite loops
    
#### Why Lambdas Are Used
LangGraph routers only receive state.
They do not receive information about which node just ran.
Each tool node therefore uses a lambda to ***bind its identity***:
```python
lambda state, key=tool_key: route_next_tool(key, state)
```
This allows route_next_tool to know which tool just executed.

**route_after_evaluation**
Determines whether the workflow should:
- End execution, or Loop back to the Supervisor for refinement
- Decision is based on state["needs_refinement"].

### 🔄 Tool Execution Loop (Example)
```python
If:

active_tools = ["pubmed", "arxiv", "web"]

Execution order will be:

query_gen_agent
 → pubmed_search
 → arxiv_search
 → web_search
 → retrieve_data

Only selected tools are executed, in a controlled order.
```
### 🧪 Refinement Loop
After synthesis:
The EvaluationAgent checks output quality -> If refinement is required -> Control returns to the Supervisor

The Supervisor decides the next step
- If acceptable:
   - Execution terminates
This allows iterative improvement without restarting the entire workflow.

### ✅ Design Benefits
Supervisor-controlled orchestration
- Deterministic tool execution
- Explicit, inspectable state
- Safe refinement loops
- Easy to extend with new tools or agents
- Production-ready architecture

### 🧠 Summary
**This LangGraph architecture models research as a controlled, state-driven process, combining:**
- Planning
- Tool orchestration
- Retrieval-augmented generation
- Evaluation and refinement
- The result is a transparent, debuggable, and scalable multi-agent system.
