Abstract: Organic and perovskite semiconductor materials are considered an interesting combination thanks to their similar processing technologies and band gap tunability.

A wide band gap lead-free ASnI<sub>2</sub>Br perovskite top subcell is utilized in conjunction with a narrow band gap DPPEZnP-TBO:PC61BM heterojunction organic bottom subcell to form the tandem configuration. The top and bottom cells were designed according to previous experimental work keeping the same materials and physical parameters. The calibration of the two cells regarding simulation and experimental data shows very good agreement, implying the validation of the simulation process. Accordingly, the two cells are combined to develop a 2T tandem cell. Further, upon optimizing the thickness of the front and rear subcells, a current matching condition is satisfied for which the proposed perovskite/organic TSC achieves an efficiency of 13.32%, <i>J<sub>sc</sub></i> of 13.74 mA/cm<sup>2</sup>, and <i>V<sub>oc</sub></i> of 1.486 V.

ZnO served as the electron transport layer (ETL), CsSnI3 as the perovskite absorption layer (PAL), and NiOx as the hole transport layer (HTL), all contributing to the optimization of device performance. To achieve the optimal power conversion efficiency (PCE), we determined the ideal PAL acceptor density (NA) to be 2 \u00d7 1019 cm\u22123 and the optimal thicknesses to be 20 nm for the ETL (ZnO), 700 nm for the PAL (CsSnI3), and 10 nm for the HTL (NiOx), with the metal electrode remaining as Au.

Abstract: Tin-based halide perovskite compounds have attracted enormous interest as effective replacements for the conventional lead halide perovskite solar cells (PCSs). However, achieving high efficiency for tin-based perovskite solar cells is still challenging. Herein, we introduced copper sulfide (CuS) as a hole transport material (HTM) in lead free tin-based B-&gamma;-CsSnI3 PSCs to enhance the photovoltaic (PV) performances. The lead free tin-based CsSnI3 perovskite solar cell structure consisting of CuS/CsSnI3/TiO2/ITO was modeled and the output characteristics were investigated by using the one dimensional solar cell capacitance simulator (SCAPS-1D). The CuS hole transport layer (HTL) with proper band arrangement may notably minimize the recombination of the charge carrier at the back side of the perovskite absorber. Density functional theory (DFT)-extracted physical parameters including the band gap and absorption spectrum of CuS were used in the SCAPS-1D program to analyze the characteristics of the proposed PV device. The PV performance parameters of the proposed device were numerically evaluated by varying the absorber thickness and doping concentration. In this work, the variation of the functional temperature on the cell outputs was also studied. Furthermore, different HTMs were employed to investigate the PV characteristics of the proposed CsSnI3 PSC. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of ~29% was achieved with open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.99 V, a fill factor of ~87%, and short circuit current density (Jsc) of 33.5 mA/cm2 for the optimized device. This work addressed guidelines and introduced a convenient approach to design and fabricate highly efficient, inexpensive, and stable lead free tin-based perovskite solar cells.",

Abstract: Abstract Despite recent abrupt rise in the efficiency of perovskite solar cells (PSCs), the contact layers maybe limit the efficiency of PSCs. The hole transporting layer (HTL) is an essential layer for reducing the recombination and loosing charges in fabricated devices by avoiding direct contact of gold to perovskite absorber layer in an efficient PSC device. The pristine spiro-OMeTAD, as most widely used HTL, still suffers from poor electrical conductivity, low hole mobility, and low oxidation rate. In this research, the nitrogen doped TiO 2 (N-TiO 2 ) proposed as a low-cost, efficient, safe replacement for spiro-OMeTAD HTL in PSCs. The variation in the device design key parameters such as the thickness and bulk defect density of perovskite layer, simultaneous modifications of defect density and defect energy level, and acceptor doping concentration in absorber layer are examined with their impact on the photovoltaic characteristic parameters. The effect of an increase in operating temperature from 280 K to 460 K on the performance of CsSnI 3 -based perovskite devices is also investigated. The standard simulated lead-free CsSnI 3 \u2013based PSCs with spiro-OMeTAD HTL by SCAPS-1D software revealed the highest power conservation efficiency (PCE) of 23.63%. The CsSnI 3 -based solar cell with N-TiO 2 as HTL showed FF (79.65%), V OC (0.98 V), J sc (34.69 mA/cm 2 ), and efficiency (27.03%) higher than the standard device with conventional spiro-OMeTAD HTL. The outcomes of N-TiO 2 presence as an HTL signify a critical avenue for the possibility of fabricating high PCE CsSnI 3 -based perovskite devices made of stable, low-cost, efficient, safe, and eco-friendly materials.",

Here, we present the design and analysis of perovskite/organic tandem solar cells (TSCs) by using a full optoelectronic simulator (SETFOS). A wide band gap lead-free ASnI 2 Br perovskite top subcell is utilized in conjunction with a narrow band gap DPPEZnP-TBO:PC61BM heterojunction organic bottom subcell to form the tandem configuration. The top and bottom cells were designed according to previous experimental work keeping the same materials and physical parameters. The calibration of the two cells regarding simulation and experimental data shows very good agreement, implying the validation of the simulation process. Accordingly, the two cells are combined to develop a 2T tandem cell. Further, upon optimizing the thickness of the front and rear subcells, a current matching condition is satisfied for which the proposed perovskite/organic TSC achieves an efficiency of 13.32%, J sc of 13.74 mA/cm 2 , and V oc of 1.486 V. On the other hand, when optimizing the tandem by utilizing full optoelectronic simulation, the tandem shows a higher efficiency of about 14%, although it achieves a decreased J sc of 12.27 mA/cm 2 . The study shows that the efficiency can be further improved when concurrently optimizing the various tandem layers by global optimization routines. Furthermore, the impact of defects is demonstrated to highlight other possible routes to improve efficiency. The current simulation study can provide a physical understanding and potential directions for further efficiency improvement for lead-free perovskite/organic TSC.",

Conventional perovskite solar cells (PSCs); however, suffer the issue that lead is toxic to the environment and organisms for a long time and is hard to excrete from the body. Therefore, it is imperative to find environmentally-friendly metal ions to replace lead for the further development of PSCs. Previous work has demonstrated that Sn, Ge, Cu, Bi, and Sb ions could be used as alternative ions in perovskite configurations to form a new environmentally-friendly lead-free perovskite structure. Here, we review recent progress on lead-free PSCs in terms of the theoretical insight and experimental explorations of the crystal structure of lead-free perovskite, thin film deposition, and device performance.

Device performance is markedly improved through increased perovskite layer thickness and reduced defect density. Further stabilization of performance is achieved by optimizing electron affinity, series resistance, and shunt resistance. Additionally, thermal stability is enhanced through the adjustment of operational temperature. The superior PCE observed in Rb 2 AuScBr 6 is ascribed to the selection of the ETL, an optimal band gap, absorber layer thickness, lower defect density, and appropriate contact interfaces. Overall, these Rb 2 AuScBr 6 and Rb 2 AuScCl 6 perovskites demonstrate exceptional promise for practical, efficient, and stable PSC applications, thereby encouraging further experimental validation and device engineering.",

            "text": ", and accessibility. Solar photovoltaic (PV) technology has emerged as a key prospect in this shift, with ongoing innovations aimed at improving efficiency and lowering costs. Researchers are advancing solar performance by integrating existing PV tech- nologies with novel materials, making high-efficiency solar power a key strat- egy for sustainable energy generation. In general, the evolution of solar PV technology can be grouped into three generations [1]. The first generation includes: crystalline silicon (c-Si), further classified into monocrystalline and polycrystalline types. Commercial monocrystalline modules typically exhibit 20\u201325% efficiency, while polycrystalline modules provide 18\u201321%, with recent research pushing monocrystalline silicon cell efficiency to 27.81% under lab- oratory conditions [2, 3]. Second-generation solar cells encompass a diverse class of thin-film technologies consisting of amorphous silicon (a-Si)[4], cad- mium telluride (CdTe) [5], chalcogenide [6], and most importantly, group III-V materials [7]. A thoroughly studied III-V absorber, GaAs, with a di- rect bandgap of 1.42 eV, has demonstrated lab efficiencies up to 29.1% for single-junction devices [8], and even higher when used in multi-junction ar- chitectures. However, due to high production costs, III\u2013V solar cells are typically reserved for niche applications such as aerospace and concentrator photovoltaics. Third-generation solar cells represent a new wave of emerging photo- voltaic technologies designed to overcome the efficiency and cost limitations 2 of first and second-generation devices. These technologies incorporate earth- abundant materials and structural innovations to enhance light absorption and charge separation.",

Notable examples of emerging photovoltaic technolo- gies include plasmonic and metamaterials based solar cells, organic solar cells (OSCs), dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), quantum dot solar cells (QDSCs), and perovskite solar cells (PSCs), as well as multi-junction tandem configu- rations [9\u201311]. These emerging photovoltaics possess unique advantages, no- tably mechanical flexibility, low-temperature solution-based fabrication pro- cess, semi-transparent operation, and compatibility with unconventional sur- faces such as windows, fabrics, and portable electronic devices [12]. Yet, de- spite such positive aspects, third-generation devices face persistent hurdles like material instability, challenges with large-scale manufacturability, and interfacial degradation. PSCs are particularly vulnerable to environmental degradation and raise concerns about lead toxicity [13], whereas QDSCs struggle with surface traps, heavy-metal constituents, and long-term stabil- ity issues [14]. DSSCs are limited by electrolyte leakage and sealing prob- lems [15], and OSCs suffer from lower efficiencies, rapid degradation, and morphological instability that impede large-area deployment [16]. Among third-generation cells, perovskite solar cells have emerged as frontrunners, reaching record efficiencies of 26.95% [8]. Perovskites adopt the ABX3 crys- tal structure, where A is an organic or inorganic cation, B is a metal cation, and X is a halide.",

Perovskite materials offer a highly tunable bandgap rang- ing from 0.96 eV for cesium silver thallium bromide (Cs2AgTlBr6) to 2.82 eV for cesium lead chloride (CsPbCl3), making them attractive for both single and multi-junction applications [17, 18]. Regardless of significant advances, single-junction solar cells remain constrained by the Shockley\u2013Queisser the- oretical efficiency limit, primarily due to excess carrier thermalization and sub-bandgap transmission losses. Multi-junction tandems mitigate these lim- itations by stacking absorbers with complementary bandgaps, and the com- positional tunability of perovskites makes them particularly advantageous for achieving optimized spectral splitting and current matching. For multi-junction tandem solar cells, the semiconducting materials em- ployed must combine optimal bandgaps with high absorption coefficients, minimal recombination losses, and good lattice compatibility to suppress in- terface defects [19]. Dual-junction tandem structures such as III\u2013V/Si [20], perovskite/Si [21], and all\u2013III\u2013V [22] or all\u2013perovskite [23] material com- binations were studied for their ability to surpass the Shockley-Queisser 3 limit of single-junction cells. More advanced triple-junction architectures, including perovskite/perovskite/Si [24] and III\u2013V/III\u2013V/Si [25] stacks, can further improve spectral utilization and reduce thermalization losses.

Ad- vancing beyond three junctions, devices with four or more junctions, typi- cally composed of III\u2013V materials, have demonstrated record-setting efficien- cies. In 2020, Geiszet al.reported a six-junction III\u2013V solar cell achieving 47.1% efficiency under 143 suns concentration through precise bandgap en- gineering and sophisticated epitaxial growth techniques [26]. Meanwhile, perovskite/Si tandem cells have attained over 30.6% efficiency in recent reports, offering a low-cost and scalable alternative to III\u2013V systems [27]. All-perovskite tandem cells incorporating Sn-Pb-based narrow-bandgap ab- sorbers have achieved 28.2% efficiency via improved grain passivation and interface quality [28]. In parallel, chalcogenide-based tandem solar cell ar- chitectures such as perovskite/CIGS [29] and perovskite/CZTS [30], have demonstrated considerable potential as sustainable, earth-abundant photo- voltaic solutions. Nonetheless, multi-junction solar cells remain constrained by high fabrication complexity, current and lattice mismatch among sub- cells, and thermal-induced spectral instability under real-world illumination conditions. Moreover, the need for precise thickness and interface control during epitaxial or layer-by-layer growth imposes scalability challenges and cost barriers for industrial deployment [31]. Careful band alignment and in- terface engineering have pushed tandem perovskite devices to efficiencies near 30% [32]. Yet additional gains can be expected via targeted bandgap tun- ing, improved interface passivation, efficient optical management, and precise current matching among subcells [33].",

Within the present framework, potas- sium tin iodide (KSnI3) [34] and formamidinium tin triiodide (FASnI3) [35] have emerged as two highly promising lead-free perovskite materials. Recent theoretical studies reported PCEs for single-junction KSnI3 cells, reaching 23.85% [36]. In comparison, FASnI3-based devices have demonstrated even higher efficiency of 28.37% [37]. These findings point towards the possibil- ity of coupling KSnI3 and FASnI3 absorbers in tandem configurations to extend device performance even further. On the chalcogenide front, silver- doped copper-zinc-tin-selenide (ACZTSe) stands out as an earth-abundant, non-toxic absorber with tunable bandgap values around 1.04\u20131.24 eV via the extent of Ag alloying [38]. All-chalcogenide tandem solar cells with ACZTSe as the bottom absorber attained PCEs of 24% in dual-junction and 36.04% in triple-junction designs [39]. Together, KSnI3 with bandgap (\u223c1.84 eV), FASnI3 (1.3\u223c1.4 eV), and ACZTSe (\u223c1.0 eV) offer complementary optical 4 characteristics, making them ideal for multi-junction tandem cell integra- tion. Their combined advantages position them as suitable contenders for ad- vancing next-generation, high-efficiency, environmentally viable photovoltaic technologies. In this study, we designed and assessed two novel lead-free tandem so- lar cells that adopted tin-based perovskite and kesterite materials, both renowned for their strong potential in prompting high-performance, non- toxic, and sustainable photovoltaic technology.",

The first phase focused on designing and simulating a single-junction so- lar cell with an n/i/p configuration, utilizing KSnI3 as the primary absorber, as shown in Fig. 1(a). With a direct bandgap of\u223c1.84 eV [34], KSnI3 is well suited as a top absorber in tandem architectures. Fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) served as a transparent front contact owing to its high optical transmittance (>85%), wide bandgap (\u223c3.6 eV), and suitable work function 5 (4.4\u20144.7 eV) [40]. Titanium dioxide (TiO2) in its anatase phase acted as an electron transport layer (ETL), offering a bandgap of 3.2 eV and favorable band alignment for electron transfer and hole blocking [36]. Copper(I) thio- cyanate (CuSCN) functioned as the hole transport layer (HTL) with valence band (\u223c5.3 eV), wide bandgap (\u223c3.6 eV), high hole mobility, and strong optical transparency, enabling efficient hole extraction and suppressed re- combination [38]. A thin magnesium fluoride (MgF2) was introduced as an anti-reflection coating (ARC) to minimize reflection losses. For the back con- tact layer (BCL), both indium tin oxide (ITO) and gold (Au) were evaluated. ITO offers high transmittance and a suitable work function (4.7\u20135.0 eV), enabling near-ohmic contact and current continuity between stacked sub- cells [41]. Subsequently, another single-junction cell with an n/n+/p/p+ configura- tion, featured in Fig. 1(b), was modeled employing FASnI3 as the absorber, with a direct bandgap of\u223c1.41 eV [35].",

TiO2 was retained as the ETL for consistency and compatibility, while a ZnO buffer layer was incorporated be- tween TiO2 and the absorber to improve electron transport. ZnO exhibits good mobility and favorable band alignment, although passivation may be required to reduce reactivity with iodide ions. For HTL, both CuSCN and Spiro-OMeTAD were examined. Spiro-OMeTAD, with a HOMO level of 5.1\u20135.3 eV, aligns closely with the FASnI3 valence band (\u223c5.2 eV), enabling efficientholeextractionandsupportingopen-circuitvoltagesabove0.9V[38]. Au and ITO were also investigated as BCL to assess their electrical perfor- mance and optical transmittance. After optimizing the single-junction devices, a double-junction (2-J) tan- dem solar cell was constructed by stacking the KSnI3 cell as the top subcell over the FASnI3 cell as the bottom subcell, as illustrated in Fig. 1(c). The same charge transport layers were retained, with TiO2 serving as the ETL and CuSCN as the HTL. An ITO interlayer was introduced as the intermedi- ate transparent conducting oxide (ITCO). Owing to its wide optical bandgap (3.5\u20144.3 eV), high visible transmittance, and strong electrical conductivity, ITO functions effectively as both a transparent electrode and a recombina- tion layer [41].

ACZTSe, a kesterite-type chalcogenide with a bandgap of 1.0 eV, exhibits high hole mobility and strong light absorption, with a valence band that aligns well with CZTSe. Zinc sulfide (ZnS) was employed as the ETL due to its wide bandgap (3.6\u20143.7 eV), suitable conduction band alignment, and high electron mobility (10\u2014100 cm2/V.s), ensuring efficient electron extraction with minimal recombination [42]. A CZTSe back sur- face field (BSF) layer was incorporated below ACZTSe, leveraging its p-type conductivity, high hole mobility (7 cm2/V\u00b7s), and slightly deeper valence band to create a favorable gradient for hole transport while blocking elec- trons [43].

We applied a hybrid optical-electrical simulation framework to design and optimize new proposed tandem solar cell architectures.

Results and discussion 3.1. Structural refinement and light-harvesting in 1-J KSnI3 cells To model the MgF2/FTO/TiO2/KSnI3/CuSCN/ITO configuration as an n/i/p single-junction solar cell architecture, as illustrated in Fig. 1(a), we considered MgF2 as ARC, FTO as TCO, TiO2 as ETL, KSnI3 as absorber, CuSCN as HTL, and ITO as BCL with initial thickness of 100 nm, 100 nm, 90 nm, 200 nm, 50 nm, and 50 nm, respectively. Initially, the doping densities of ETL, absorber, and HTL were set to 5\u00d71018, 1\u00d71015, and 1\u00d71018 cm-3, respectively. To establish the baseline device behavior, we performed prelim- inary thickness sweeps of the KSnI3 absorber, TiO2 ETL, and CuSCN HTL to identify performance-sensitive regions and define the parameter space for subsequent detailed optimization. The corresponding results are provided in Figs. S2 and S3 of the Supplementary Material. 10 Afterward, following the self-consistent optimization process as featured in Fig. 2, final iterative thickness optimization of the KSnI3 absorber, TiO2 ETL, and CuSCN HTL were performed to maximize device performance. First, the thickness of KSnI3 was varied from 200 to 1200 nm while keep- ing the ETL and HTL thicknesses at 40 and 100 nm, respectively, as shown in Fig. 3(a). PCE increased steadily from 11.32% at 200 nm to a peak of 12.95% at 700 nm, after which further thickness increases led to marginal decreases in efficiency.",

This trend reflects the trade-off between enhanced photon absorption and increased carrier recombination in a thicker KSnI3 absorber. Jsc increased with thickness due to improved light photon absorp- tion in the 600\u2013700 nm wavelength range, whereas Voc and FF decreased slightly, indicating higher recombination and series resistance effects. This trend is observed in Figs. S4(b-d). Subsequently, a parametric sweep of the TiO2 ETL (20\u2013160 nm) and CuSCN HTL (60\u2013160 nm) was conducted with the absorber thickness fixed at 700 nm as shown in Figs. 3(c-f). Analysis revealed that, a 40 nm thickness of TiO2 and a 100 nm thickness of CuSCN yielded a peak PCE of 12.95%, with Jsc of 15.28 mA/cm2, Voc of 1.247 V, and FF of 67.94%. Reducing the ETL thickness weakened the built-in electric field, thereby limiting electron extraction, while excessive thickness intro- duced additional series resistance and hindered charge transport. Similarly, optimizing the HTL thickness proved essential for maintaining efficient hole transport without compromising carrier collection at the interface. These findings highlight the importance of carefully balancing layer thicknesses to achieve optimal device performance. We then explored doping density variations in the transport layers. The donor density (ND) of TiO2 and acceptor density (NA) of CuSCN were var- ied from 5\u00d71016 to 5\u00d71019 cm-3 with the results visualized in Figs. S5(a-d).",

To reduce the interfacial band offset at the KSnI3/TiO2 junction, UV- ozone-treated TiO2 was employed, shifting the TiO2 work function (\u03d5TiO2 ) from 5.3 eV (oxidized TiO2 film) to 5.1 eV. Klasenet al.reported that UV-ozone treatment significantly increased the surface conductance of TiO2 films by over two orders of magnitude, mitigated surface oxygen vacancies, 12 and enhanced charge extraction, resulting in a 2% increase in the average PCE of perovskite solar cells [66]. Implementing this treatment in the 1-J KSnI3 device gained an improved PCE of 15.30%, as presented in Table S2. Next, instead of ITO as BCL, 50 nm Au BCL was utilized to further boost the single junction performance by achieving further absorption through back reflection in the wavelength range of 550\u2013690 nm, as shown in Fig. S6(b). This additional absorption enhanced Jsc from 15.61 to 16.62 mA/cm2. The final optimum PCE (\u03b7) was found 16.28% with Jsc of 16.62 mA/cm2, Voc of 1.23V, and FF of 79.50%.

Incorporating CuSCN as hole transport layer To model and perform opto-electronic simulation for 1-J FASnI3 cell (MgF2/ITO/ZnO/FASnI3/CuSCN/ITO), the same optimization procedures described previously were followed.

Preliminary thickness sweeps of the FASnI3 absorber, TiO2 ETL, and CuSCN HTL were performed to identify performance-sensitive regions and establish the baseline for subsequent optimization, as shown in Figs.

After identifying the performance-sensitive region, we systematically var- ied the thicknesses of TiO2, FASnI3, and CuSCN to achieve self-consistent de- vice performance, as depicted in Figs. 5(a) and Figs.

The improvement with increasing thickness is primarily attributed to enhanced optical absorption and photo-carrier generation within the FASnI3 layer. Beyond 800 nm, PCE exhibited a slight saturation, reflecting the com- peting effect of increased recombination losses once the absorber thickness exceededthecarrierdiffusionlength.

Triple-junction architecture: layer-wise optimization and device effi- ciency Before building the triple-junction KSnI3/FASnI3/ACZTSe tandem cell, we introduced ITO as the ITCO and BCL in the middle FASnI3 subcell to facilitate the efficient passage of excess low-energy photon injection to the bottom cell. This modification improved optical transmission across the Figure 8: (a) Carrier generation rate, G, towards the illumination of sunlight in the Y direction, highlighting the maximum carrier generation regions.

However, an initial drop in performance parameters occurred due to reduced optical back reflection and photon reabsorption, as summa- rized in Table S3. Next, we modeled the third subcell as follows: AZO/ZnO/ZnS/ACZTSe/ CZTSe/Mo. For optimization purposes, the initial thickness and doping den- sity were taken as shown in Table S4. At first, the ACZTSe absorber thick- ness was varied from 400 to 1400 nm, under constant acceptor doping. The results showed a peak PCE of 25.77% for a 750 nm thickness of ACZTSe as Fig. 9(a). Subsequently, NA of ACZTSe absorber layer was varied from 1\u00d71014 to 1\u00d71015 cm-3. The maximum PCE of 26.08% was achieved at NA of 1\u00d71015 cm-3, as shown in Fig. 9(b). However, beyond a NA value of 9\u00d71014 cm-3, a declining trend in Jsc was noticed from Table S5 of Supple- mentary Material, indicating increased electron\u2013hole recombination at the ACZTSe/CZTSe junction. Therefore, NA of 9\u00d71014 cm\u22123 was selected for 23 further optimization. Afterwards, n-doped ZnS and n-doped ZnO layer thick- nesses were varied as shown in Figs. 9(c) and 9(d). For a ZnS buffer layer thickness of 90 nm and a ZnO layer thickness of 20 nm, the highest PCE of 26.67% was achieved. Subsequently, to evaluate the influence of the CZTSe back surface field (BSF) layer, its thickness was varied from 110 to 250 nm, as shown in Fig. 9(e). The results indicate a rising trend in PCE, increas- ing from 27.1% and peaking at 27.69% for a BSF thickness of 220 nm.",

This improvement suggests enhanced lateral absorption in the ACZTSe layer, con- tributing to better device performance. NA of the ACZTSe layer was varied from 1\u00d71016 to 1\u00d71017 cm-3. As illustrated in Fig. 9(f), the PCE exhibits a steady increase from 1\u00d71016 to 1\u00d71017 cm\u22123 and continues to rise with higher doping densities. However, Liet al.reported that increasing the NA of CZTSe from 1015 to 1018 cm-3 significantly reduced the trap-assisted car- rier lifetime from 5 ns to 13 ps, indicating higher recombination losses [67]. Therefore, NA of 6\u00d71016 cm-3 was selected as a trade-off, yielding a PCE of 27.71%, with Jsc of 12.11 mA/cm2, Voc of 2.726 V, and FF of 83.98% for the 3-J tandem cell. Afterward, the thickness of the ITO tunnel layer between the middle and bottom subcell was varied as shown in Figs. 10(a) and (b). As the ITO thickness increases, enhanced reflection of the overall tandem cell and carrier recombination are observed. This phenomenon led to a decrease in the PCE of both the middle and bottom subcells, along with the overall 3-J tandem cell. Based on this analysis, a 20 nm ITO thickness was selected as an opti- mal trade-off, balancing device stability with efficient charge transport. To determine the overall optimal performance of the 3-J tandem cell, the thicknesses of the primary absorber layers in each subcell were systematically varied, while maintaining constant thicknesses for the transport and recom- bination layers.",

Figs. 10(c-f) present the performance metrics corresponding to the volumetric parametric thickness sweep for the KSnI3, FASnI3, and ACZTSe.

This behavior can be attributed to the monolithic 2-T configuration of the tandem structure, which requires a uniform Jsc across all subcells.

How- ever, Voc was observed to be higher for thinner regions of KSnI3 and FASnI3 as shown in Fig. 10(e). This trend arises from increased carrier recombina- tion associated with a larger absorber thickness, which in turn elevates the dark saturation current density (J0) and, consequently, reduces Voc. The FF shows a consistent increase with ACZTSe thickness, likely due to enhanced carrier collection and reduced recombination. For KSnI3, FF improved as thickness increased, providing better charge transport and current matching. However, FASnI3 demonstrated an optimal FF at an intermediate thickness, beyond which resistive losses became dominant. This consistent behaviour underscores the crucial role of KSnI3 in maintaining a high FF as illustrated Table 5: Summary of performance metrics of the 3-J tandem cell as a function of thickness and doping density variations in the bottom subcell.

In contrast, our work proposes novel double and triple-junction tandem ar- chitectures integrating lead-free, tin-based perovskites (KSnI3 and FASnI3) and an earth-abundant kesterite absorber (ACZTSe). This design achieved competitive PCEs of 27.29% for 2-J tandem and 30.69% for 3-J tandem cells, respectively, while simultaneously addressing critical issues such as toxicity, 31 material scarcity, and infrared spectral coverage. The absorption edge of the ACZTSe layer boosted infrared photon absorption, enhancing current- matching and device efficiency. Moreover, band alignment and intermediate transportation layers were optimized to provide efficient charge extraction as depicted from high fill factors exceeding several reported perovskite tandems. Even though the oxidation of tin is still an issue, it can be alleviated by us- ing encapsulation and interface engineering methods. By avoiding toxic lead and scarce dopants like rubidium or bromide, our tandem cells offer an envi- ronmentally friendly, scalable, and high-performance platform that balances efficiency, stability, and sustainability more effectively than many existing perovskite tandem designs. 4.",

Feasibility of the proposed 3-J tandem cell architecture The fabrication of the proposed triple junction tandem cell architecture requires precise and sequential deposition techniques optimized according to the thermal and chemical sensitivities of each constituent layer. The process commences with the deposition of a thin MgF2 ARC via thermal or electron beam evaporation, designed to reduce optical losses at the air/glass inter- face [73]. Subsequently, highly conductive FTO films are deposited using radio frequency (RF) magnetron sputtering, which offers strong adhesion, uniformity, and scalability [74]. Anatase-phase TiO2 thin films are then pre- pared on the FTO surface through spin-coating followed by annealing. Post- annealing, UV\u2013ozone treatment is employed to enhance surface properties for subsequent layer integration [66]. The deposition of KSnI3 absorber layer, though still limited experimentally, can be achieved via spin-coating a pre- cursor solution of potassium iodide (KI) and tin(II) iodide (SnI2) in a solvent mixture of N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). This is followed by thermal annealing to promote crystallization, following methodologies adapted from tin-based perovskite literature [75]. Afterwards, CuSCN HTL is applied through spin-coating from a dipropyl sulfide solution and mildly annealed to form a compact and hydrophobic interface [76]. ITO interlayer is then deposited by low-temperature sputtering to preserve the integrity of the underlying layers [77].",

ZnO is introduced as ETL layer either by atomic layer deposition (ALD) or low-temperature sol\u2013gel techniques, fol- lowed by a second compact TiO2 layer. The FASnI3 absorber is deposited using an antisolvent-assisted spin-coating method, incorporating SnF2 as an additive to improve phase stability and reduce hysteresis [78]. Subsequently, 32 Spiro-OMeTAD is spin-coated from a chlorobenzene solution containing Li- TFSI and 4-tert-butylpyridine (tBP) as dopants to enhance hole mobility [79]. A second transparent ITO layer ( 20 nm) is sputtered, followed by an Al-doped ZnO (AZO) layer to reduce sheet resistance and enhance optical transmission. ZnO and ZnS buffer layers are deposited via ALD or chemical bath deposition (CBD), ensuring favorable band alignment and reduced in- terfacial recombination [80]. ACZTSe/CZTSe absorber stack is subsequently formed through co-sputtering of Cu, Zn, Sn, Se, and Ag, followed by high- temperature selenization to achieve the desired kesterite phases and interface quality [81]. Molybdenum (Mo) back contact layer is deposited via DC mag- netron sputtering to serve as a chemically stable, low-resistance electrode. To ensure both environmental and operational stability, the device is encap- sulated with a UV-curable epoxy and sealed with a glass barrier. 5.",

Conclusion The design and optimization of high-efficiency tandem solar cells calls for a holistic approach, that encompasses several interconnected aspects, such as the selection and incorporation of complementary absorber materials, precise tunnel junction engineering, and accurate matching of photocurrent among the subcells. In this paper, we have addressed these challenges by intro- ducing two new lead-free tandem solar cell architectures, an all-perovskite dual-junction solar cell (KSnI3/FASnI3) and a hybrid perovskite-kesterite triple-junction solar cell (KSnI3/FASnI3/ACZTSe). The chosen absorbers effectively cover from near-UV to NIR spectral region, reducing bandgap disparities and enhancing overall photon utilization. By systematically op- timizing the absorber thickness, doping density, and tunnel-junction band alignment, the proposed architectures achieved effective current matching and enhanced charge transport throughout the device. The dual-junction cell delivered a PCE of 27.29% with Jsc of 14.74 mA/cm2, Voc of 2.227 V, and FF of 83.14%. Subsequently, after integration and careful optimization of the triple junction subcell, the optimized triple-junction configuration reached a champion PCE of 30.69% with Jsc of 13.184 mA/cm2, Voc of 2.766 V, and FF of 84.18%, corresponding to a relative PCE gain of 12.5% over the dual- junction architecture.",

As shown in Fig. S2(b), increas- ing the KSnI3 absorber thickness from 150 to 1200 nm led to a steady rise in Jsc due to enhanced optical absorption and improved photon harvesting within the bulk region. However, as the absorber thickness increases, carri- ers generated deeper inside the absorber experience longer transport paths and higher recombination probability, especially beyond 750 nm for our case. This resulted in a gradual decrease in Voc and FF as shown in Figs.

Consequently, the PCE rises with thickness, reach- ing a maximum of 21.69% at 900 nm, beyond which the trade-off between enhanced absorption and recombination causes a slight decline.

However, the tendency of Sn2+ oxidation to Sn4+ in the tin-based perovskites induces serious film degradation an d performance deterioration. Herein, we demonstrate, through the density functional 2 theory based first -principle calculations in a surface slab model, that the surface defects of the Sn -based perovskite FASnI 3 (FA = NH 2CHNH2+) could be effectively passivated by the Lewis base molecules. The passivation performance of Lewis base molecules in tin -based perovskite is tightly correlated with their molecular hardness. We reveal that the degree of hardness of Lewis a dsorbate governs the stabilization via dual effects: first, changing the stubborn spatial distribution of tin vacancy (VSn) by triggering charge redistribution; second, saturating the dangling states while simultaneously reducing the amounts of deep band gap states. Specifically, the hard Lewis base molecules like edamine (N-donor group) and Isatin -Cl (Cl -donor group) would show a better healing effect than other candidates on the defects-contained tin-based perovskite surface with a somehow hard Lewis acid nature.",

Introduction Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have be en under the spotlight due to their superior optoelectronic properties and solution processability for the next 3 generation of photovoltaic technology.1, 2 In the past decade, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of lead-based PSCs boost rapidly from 3.8% to 25.7%, comparable with the commercial silicon solar cell. 3 However, the toxicity of lead and potential environmental hazard hinder their practical application.4 As an alternative, a series of lead-free pe rovskite materials, including Sn, Bi, and Ge -based perovskites have been widely explored.5-8 In particular, tin -based alternatives resemble the ir lead- contained counterpart, as t he neighboring Sn and Pb elements in the periodic table shar e a similar valence structure.",

This oxidation process further accelerates the decomposition of perovskite film15, 16 akin to the process: 4 2FASnI3 + O2 \u2192 SnI4 + SnO2 + 2FAI (1) A recent work also proved the strong coupling between film oxidation and tin vacancy (VSn) defect formation, which is the dominant type of defect for both the Sn-rich and I-rich situations in FASnI3.17 Moreover, the energy level of Sn-5s orbital is higher than that of Pb- 6s orbital, impelling both the defect formation and tin oxidation. 18 The lowered redox potential of Sn 2+/Sn4+ at +0.15 eV makes Sn 2+ easily oxidized to Sn 4+.19, 20 This is associated with a higher energetically lying antibonding orbital and thus weaker Sn -I bonds than the Pb -contained compounds.",

The second equation suggests that those two holes can be further trapped by a Sn2+ which is oxidized into Sn4+. Therefore, as dictated by equation (1) and (2), both the Lewis acid type Sn2+ oxidation and the generation of surface VSn defects occur simultaneously. Accumulation of such defects is responsible for the degraded performance and structures in tin-based PSCs , usually associated with defects induced loss of open voltage (Voc), high background hole density, and blue shift in absorption edge.21, 22 5 To effectively mitigate the defects and associated effects shown above, reductive organic agents are introduced during the fabrication of tin-based PSCs.23, 24 These additives act as the Lewis base to stabilize the defect s- contained perovskite (be hard Lewis acid like) by supplying extra charge.25 For example, Kamarudin et al. used the edamine to passivate surface dangling bonds of FASnI 3 which act as non -radiative recombination centers, a long diffusion distance of up to 300 nm and high efficiency of 10.18% were obtained after passivation.26 On the other hand, the inclusion of organic additives with different functional group s lead to significantly diverse performance of defect passivation.26 Gu et al.",

This strategy significantly reduced V Sn defect density and suppressed tin oxidation reflected by the increased Voc and reduced dark current density. 27 Similarly, Park et al. investigated the interaction between the reductive surface ligand and perovskite film through adopting different binding groups, among which the carboxyl -contained p-Toluic acid ( p-TA) molecules showed the best improvement of efficiency , and significant shifts of ionization energy and electron affinity by adsorption of additives were observed.28 Ethanedithiol (EDT) molecule with a hydrophobic nature 6 has also been extensively used in the PSCs due to its goo d passivating ability.29, 30 Xiong et al. used a kind of organic dye named 5 -chloroisatin (Isatin-Cl) to passivate the uncoordinated defects and eliminate the p-type doping within the film.31 Some representative Lewis base additive usages, regardless of the final PCE, are listed in Table.

These results shed light on the atomic-scale mechanisms of promoting the efficiencies of PSCs via charge-compensation engineering. 2. Computational details The calculations using density functional theory (DFT) were performed based on the projector augmented wave (PAW) potential method implemented in the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP).33, 34 The generalized gradient approximation (GGA) of the Perdew -Burke-Ernzerh function (PBE) was employed to describe the exchange -correlation potential.35 By setting a 500 eV cutoff energy on the wave function, a 2\u00d7 2\u00d7 1 and another denser 3\u00d7 3\u00d7 1 Monkhorst-Pack k -point mesh were applied for the surface model optimization and the electronic properties calculation, respectively.

Results and Discussion 3.1 Localized state of pristine surface of FASnI3: Figure 1a and b show the optimized FASnI3 surface structures without and with V Sn defect, respectively. The presence of V Sn breaks the skeleton connectivity and induces the distortion of the SnI 5 octahedron around the defect. The removal of one surface Sn atom leads to five dangling iodine atoms which are relaxed outwardly from the V Sn. There is an enhanced hybridization and chemical bonding of these dangling iodine atoms with their Sn neighbors a s indicative of the shortened Sn -I bond length decreasing from 3.15 \u00c5 for the pristine surface to 2.92 \u00c5. The electronic structure of the defects is an underlying factor that governs the polarity of carriers and response of photo excitation. The spatial di stribution of the 9 defective states of V Sn is plotted in Fig. 1b. Surprisingly, the defective states do not locate at the dangling I atoms as normal vacancy states do. Instead, such a localized state is found at the neighboring Sn atom toward the bulk interior and penetrates several atom layers, i ndicating a strong redox ability of VSn for producing Sn2+/Sn4+ oxidation. Thus, the presence of VSn defect tends to cause the oxidation of adjacent Sn atoms and the surface structure unstable. This self -doping mechanism is responsible for the degraded per formance and structural instability of the non- stoichiometric tin-based perovskite.19, 40 To this end, we aim to passivate such surface states by introducing the Lewis base molecules.

We consider the Sn deficient FASnI3 (001) surface where a V Sn is created at the top surface plane (Fig. 1b). As expected, such molecules are less likely to be adsorbed at the VSn core where weak van der Waals interaction s occur between the molecule and dangling iodine groups. The Lewis base molecules passivate the VSn through an indirect way, the molecules bonding with the exposed Sn atoms surrounding the V Sn core rather than the V Sn core itself. The edamine molecule interact s with the exposed Sn atom s by forming a covalent Sn -N bond with a length of 2.60 \u00c5; the pa ssivation of p-TA through the Sn-O bond with the shortest bond length of 2.05 \u00c5; the EDT adsorbed through the Sn-S bond with a bond length of 2.46 \u00c5; the Isatin - Cl anchors through Sn-Cl bond with the longest bond length of 2.92 \u00c5 (Fig. S2).

The largest amount of charge transfer in the p-TA/perovskite system (Fig. 2c) is consistent with its largest Eads, while the Isatin -Cl (Fig. 2b) has the smallest charge transfer, as the Cl atom has a relatively weak interaction with the perovskite surface.

The longer the Sn -I bond length, th e larger the electron transfer value, which indicates the passivation of the surface and suppression of tin oxidation. The importance of charge compensation for V Sn is realized until recently, through which the background hole can be largely neutralized, hence the prolonged charge 15 carrier lifetime and promoted mobility. 46 Also, this compensation can release the VSn induced lattice strain.47, 48 Figure 3.

These deep levels, including the surface VSn defects, act as electron traps and recombination centers in the tin-based PSCs. Thus, the reductive molecule additives are designed to suppress these defects. The enlarged band gap and reduced metallic density near the Fermi level in Fig. 5 can be attributed to the effective healing of defect healing, where the surface states have been partially compensated by the surface molecule.

As discussed above, each VSn is likely to induce excess holes which cause the oxidation of the nearby Sn2+ to Sn 4+, thus the healing effect to these vacancies induced background charge is so -called charge compensation.

As shown in Fig. 6, however, the effect of the passivation seems to vary with molecules. Upon the adsorption of EDT, the V Sn associated defective state is still located at the Sn atom beneath the V Sn site, which suggests a remarkable barrier for the polaron hopping around these two Lewis adsorbates. In contrast, interestingly, the uptake of edamin e, p-TA, and Isatin-Cl above the surface both induce an upward shift of the defective state toward the surface adsorbate, implying a significant electronic coupling between the VSn and such Lewis complex. Our calculations reveal that edamine and Isatin-Cl are more effective to compensate the VSn associated hole states 19 compared with the intrinsic Sn2+/Sn4+ transition. According to the classical hard-soft-acid-base theory (HSAB), edamine and Isatin-Cl are regarded as hard Lewis base, and thus they are more pr one to interact with the V Sn contained perovskite surface which is hard Lewis acid.51, 52 The Lewis base with large hardness transfers the electron to the perovskite layer and passivate the surface defects, accordingly an enlarged band gap is achieved for edamine and Isatin-Cl passivated structures. Although the defects can\u2019t be entirely neutralized by the Lewis base, rational designed molecular dopant alters the electronic screening and accommodate excess holes thus effectively reducing the tin deficient surface.

Lewis base molecule modulated spatial distribution of VSn defect states. The charge density of the surface defects is plotted with the iso - surface value of 0.001e/Bohr3. Here our work shows that different functional groups in the molecules may affect the adsorption and charge transfer. For instance, the soft Lewis base p-TA and EDT passivate the surface by strong interaction with the uncoordinated Sn atoms. But an inverse charge transfer, from perovskite to molecules, makes little contribution to background hole density neutralization. Comparingly, the hard Lewis base edamine and Isatin -Cl stabilize surface defects through charge compensation. Their moderate interaction intensity and charge transfer are also favorable for the starching of surface Sn-I bonds, hence the reduced lattice strain. To further prove our idea of the passivation of defects through Lewis base, we also examined the adsorption of soft Lewis base molecules above the FASnI 3 surface. Herein the benzene sulfonic acid (BSA) as a soft Lewis base was considered. As shown in Fig. S2, the passivation effect of the BSA is close to that of the sulfur -contained EDT and carboxyl -contained p-TA. Thus, the Lewis base mainly influences the perovskite surface through two aspects: Firstly, the functional ligand coordinates with the undersaturated tin atoms, the f ollowing charge compensation reduce the SnI 5 distortion and avoid further tin oxidation (Fig.",

Baring mind that our pristine surface model contains a high density of unsaturated Sn atoms, such dangling states extend within the band gap of the bulk FASnI3 which makes a very narrow band gap. All the Lewis base molecules are found to passivate such dangling states and broaden the band gap. The upwardly shifted band position proves the released p-type doping by the Lewis base edamine and p-TA molecule passivation. For the eda mine passivation, the appropriate band position is suitable for acting as the intrinsic layer to connect the electron transfer layer and hole transfer layer in PSCs. In contrast, the significantly lowered band position by the passivation of Isatin -Cl can be used to connect with the hole transfer layer. For the BSA and EDT cases, the rich residual defective states imply an unfavourable photoelectric utilization. Hence, surface molecule adsorption is also an effective method for tuning the band alignment of tin perovskite with other selective layers. 4.

Abstract In the previous decade, there has been a significant advancement in the performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs), characterized by a notable increase in efficiency from 3.8% to 25%. Nonetheless, PSCs face many problems when we commercialize them because of their toxicity and stability. Consequently, lead-PSCs need an alternative solar cell with high performance and low processing cost; lead-free inorganic perovskites have been explored . Recent research showcased Cs2CuBiCl6, a lead -free inorganic double perovskite material with remarkable photoelectric characteristics and exceptional environmental robustness.",

            "text": "Recent research showcased Cs2CuBiCl6, a lead -free inorganic double perovskite material with remarkable photoelectric characteristics and exceptional environmental robustness. To investigate the potential of Cs2CuBiCl6 material, the solar cell structure FTO/ETL/Cs2CuBiCl6/HTL/Au was used and analyzed through a solar cell capacitance simulator (SCAPS-1D). CeO2 is used as the Electron transport layer (ETL), and CuI is the Hole transport layer (HTL). Furthermore, the research examined the optimization of different parameters of the absorber layer (AL), such as thickness, defect density, electron affinity, band gap, and operational temperature. In the end, it has been noticed that by setting the temperature at 300 K and an electron affinity of 4.3 eV of the absorber layer, the PSCs achieve the highest efficiency of 24.51 %, FF of 43.01 %, Voc of 1.73V, and Jsc of 32.82mA/cm2. This is the highest Cs2CuBiCl6 double PSCs efficiency we've reached yet. In theoretical studies , 17.03% of PCE was achieved using Cs 2CuBiCl6 as an active layer. The analysis underscores the significant potential of Cs2CuBiCl6 as an absorbing layer in developing highly efficient lead -free all - inorganic PSCs. Keyword: lead-free inorganic perovskites, Cs2CuBiCl6, ETL (CeO2), HTL (CuI), Optimization, SCAPS-1D 1. Introduction Energy consumption is currently at its highest levels , with demand projected to rise further due to the ever-increasing global population. This situation underscores the urgent need to identify alternative energy sources beyond fossil fuels. Such efforts are essential for sustaining a healthy society and environment and meeting global energy requirements.",

            "text": "to identify alternative energy sources beyond fossil fuels. Such efforts are essential for sustaining a healthy society and environment and meeting global energy requirements. Among the various solutions, renewable energy -based solar cell technolog ies have emerged as one of the most promising approaches to address the ongoing energy crisis [1, 2]. Since the 1950s, silicon - as the primary material in first-generation solar cells- has been widely used in photovoltaic applications due to its high efficiency. However, its extraction and production costs remain prohibitively expensive [1]. A first -generation solar cell offers superior efficiency but comes with higher production costs. Second-generation solar cells, also known as thin -film solar cells, were introduced in response to these challenges . These are fabricated using amorphous silicon, cadmium telluride (CdTe), and copper indium gallium Selenide (CIGS). While second -generation solar cells are lighter, more flexible, and cheaper to produce than first -generation silicon-based solar cells, they generally exhibit lower efficiencies , shorter lifespans, and pose potential environmental and health risks due to using toxic materials during production and disposal [2]. The third generation of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) was developed to overcome these limitations . PSCs have garnered significant attention over the past two decades due to their rapid efficiency improvements and potential for low -cost production [3].",

Several unique physic-chemical properties contribute to the popularity of PSCs: i) an adjustable energy band gap, ii) efficient utilization of incident light utilization, iii) cost-effective and versatile preparation techniques, and iv) rapid progress in research and development. Remarkably, PSCs achieved a dramatic enhancement in po wer conversion efficiency (PCE), increasing from 3.8% to 25.7% within a short time period [4, 5] . Structurally, PSCs typically comprise a transparent conducting oxide TCO (e.g., FTO and ITO), an electron transport layer ETL, a hole transport layer HTL, and a perovskite layer (i.e., perovskite layer positioned between the ETL and HTL layer. Perovskites are materials characterized by the general formula ABX3, where 'A' represents a large cation, 'B' denotes a smaller Cation, and 'X' is a halide anion. By introducing new elements through doping, novel perovskite structures with enhanced optoelectronic properties can be engineered . Bismuth- based double perovskite is a particularly intriguing class of perovskite with researchers\u2019 attention. These materials offer significant potential for solar energy applications due to their high stability, efficient generation of electron -hole pairs, and tunable optoelectronic properties [6, 7] . Double perovskite (DP), also known as an elpasolite, is derived by replacing one monovalent B+ and one trivalent B 3+ ion with a Pb2+ ion in the traditional perovskite structure, resulting in the formula A2B+B3+X6(Cs2CuBiCl6) [8].",

In Double perovskite solar cells, the absorber layer - a thin film of double perovskite material - is crucial for absorbing light and generating electron -hole pairs . These absorber layers are central to distinct characteristics and enhanced performance of double perovskite solar cells. Compared to conventional perovskites, double perovskites offer notable advantages, including higher stability, superior electron -hole pair production, and customizable optoelectronic properties, making them a promising alternative for next-generation photovoltaic technologies. Cs2CuBiCl6 is a promising lead -free double perovskite due to its optimal 1.1 eV band gap, facilitating efficient light absorption and conversion into electricity while exhibiting impressive stability for sustained performance. This exceptional stability enhances the material's suitability for solar cell applications [9]. Moreover, i ts remarkable optical properties further augment its ability to effectively capture and convert solar energy [10]. Double perovskites offer a sustainable alternative by replacing the lead with a combination of other metals. For instance, one of the most researched double perovskites is Cs 2AgBiBr6, where silver (Ag) and bismuth (Bi) substitute lead, resulting in a lead -free material with promising photovoltaic properties [11].

Recent studies have demonstrated the potential of double perovskite in photovoltaic applications. For example, Kale et al. reported a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 17.03% using TiO 2 as ETL Cu 2O as HTL and Cs2CuBiCl6 as absorber layer [12]. Mohandas et al. utilized Cs2AgBiBr6, as the active layer and reported a PCE efficiency of 1.44% by using SCAPS-1D. Furthermore, Ferdous et al. simulated Cs2TiI2Br4-based double PSCs and gained an impressive efficiency of 23.41% [13]. In this research, Cs2CuBiCl6 was selected as the absorber layer due to its superior material capabilities and the scarcity of comparative studies on this compound. According to the literature, only one study has been conducted using Cs2CuBiCl6 as a double perovskite layer [12]. This work aims to address this gap by systematically exploring the photovoltaic performance of lead-free double perovskite solar cells employing FTO/CeO2/Cs2CuBiCl6/CuI/Au configuration using SCAPS -1D simulation software.

During all parameter changes, the optimized parameter remains unchanged throughout the optimization process. 3.1.Influence of the double perovskite layer (DPL) thicknesses The absorber layer's thickness plays a crucial role in determining the performance of PSCs. When light falls on solar cells, electron -hole pairs are generated, leading to electricity production. An optimized PL thickness is crucial for maximizing the device's generation of charge carriers (electrons and holes) . In this study , the PL thickness was varied from 0.450 to 2.000 \u00b5m while maintaining the other parameters of different layers, as presented in Tables 1 and 2. It was observed that increasing the PL thickness negatively impacted the key solar cell parameters, including the Voc, Jsc, FF, and PCE, as illustrated in Figure 2 (a, b). This decline in performance can be attributed to increased charge recombination and light transmittance losses within the device at greater thickness. The absorber layer's thickness significantly affects the solar cell performance since both the saturation current density (Jo) and the device's short circuit current (Jsc) are close to open-circuit voltage (VOC). According to the equation 4: \ud835\udc49\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc50 = \ud835\udc3e\ud835\udc47 \ud835\udc5e ln (\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc50 \ud835\udc57\ud835\udc5c + 1) 4 Where K is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature, and Q is the electronic charge, it is evident that any changes in Jo or Jsc due to absorber layer thickness directly influence Voc .",

Optimizing the defect density is critical for enhancing device performance, as Nt directly influences the quality of the absorber film. An increase in defect density deteriorates the film quality, leading to a higher rate of charge carrier recombination, adversely affecting the solar cell's overall efficiency. A high defect density in the AL has been identified as a primary cause of reduced PCE due to the abundance of recombination centers [27, 28]. Figure 3(a, b) illustrates the trend in key performance parameters , including PCE, J sc, and FF as a function of Nt . The results show that increasing Nt leads to a significant reduction in these parameters. However, variations in Nt did not result in noticeable fluctuations in the V oc. One possible reason for this reduction in performance is the increased likelihood of charge carriers (electrons and holes) being trapped by defects in the material at higher Nt values .",

Consequently, at high defect densities , all key output metrics of the solar cell - PCE, J sc, FF and V oc experience significant degradation . From the analysis, it was established that optimal device performance was achieved at a defect density of 1E15 cm\u22123, which yielding notable values: PCE of 20.43%, V oc of 0.8978V, J sc of 33.639722mA/cm2, and FF of 67.65% [34, 35]. The result underscores the critical role of minimizing defect density to achieve high -performance solar cells. Elevated defect densities introduce numerous recombination centers and traps, which impede charge carrier transport and significantly reduce device functionality. It is evident that superior device performance can only be attained by maintaining a low defect density in the absorber layer. Figure 3.

Figure 4(a, b) presents the trends in all solar cell performance parameters as a function of the absorber\u2019s electron affinity .

Specifically, the PCE improved from 20.43% at 4.1 eV to a maximum of 24.51% at 4.3 eV , marking a substantial enhancement in efficiency, as shown in Figure 4 (a) . This improvement can be attributed to optimized energy - level alignment, which facilitates efficient charge carrier transport and minimizes recombination losses at the interfaces between absorber and transport layers. While the initial increase in electron affinity enhances charge transport efficiency, excessively high electron affinity values likely result in excessive electron transport from the ETL to the absorber, destabilizing the charge separation process. This destabilization negatively impacts overall device performance and leads to a notable reduction in PCE. Figure 4. Impact of electron affinity on (a) FF and Efficiency (b) Voc and Jsc.

This destabilization negatively impacts overall device performance and leads to a notable reduction in PCE. The results demonstrated that optimizing the electron affinity of the perovskite absorber layer is critical for achieving high device performance. An electron affinity value of approximately 4.3 eV is identified as an optimal condition, yielding the highest PCE of 24.51%. Beyond these values, the misalignment of energy levels between absorber and transport layers compromises charge carrier dynamics, reducing device efficiency. These findings highlight the importance of fine-tuning the electronic properties of the absorber layer to achieve the best possible performance in PSCs. 3.4.Influence of band gap (Eg) of the absorber layer Numerous factors influence the efficiency and productivity of the photovoltaic cell performance. [29, 30]. Among these, the band gap of the absorber layer is a critical parameter. The band gap represents the energy difference between the valance band maximum and the conduction band minimum, directly impacting the light absorption, charge carrier generation, and overall performance of photovoltaic devices. This study systematically investigated the impact of varying the band gap of the absorber layer on the performance of PSCs .",

            "text": ", and overall performance of photovoltaic devices. This study systematically investigated the impact of varying the band gap of the absorber layer on the performance of PSCs . To evaluate this effect, the band gap of the absorber layer was varied from 1.12eV to 1.45 eV. Figure 5 (a,b) displays the I-V curve of the PSC with the configuration of CeO 2/Cs2CuBiCl6 /CuI as a function of the absorber layer band gap. The analysis reveals a clear trend; as the band gap of the perovskite layer increases, the PCE also increases, reaching a peak before declining at higher band gap values. The maximum PCE of 20.086% was achieved at an optimal band gap of 1.4 eV, corresponding to Voc of 1.26%, Jsc = 54.74 mA/cm2, and FF = 54.74%. This enhancement in the PCE up to a band gap of 1.41 eV can be attributed to improved light absorption in the visible spectrum and better alignment of energy levels, which enhance charge carrier separation and transport. As the band gap increases beyond 1.41 eV, a noticeable decline in PCE is observed. At a band gap of 1.45 eV, both Jsc and FF significantly decrease, while Voc exhibits moderate increases. This reduction in Jsc is likely due to decreased light absorption, as a higher band gap limits the range of the solar spectrum that the absorber layer can effectively absorb . Similarly, the decline in FF can be attributed to increased recombination, adversely affecting charge carrier collection efficiency. The moderate increase in V oc with the band gap can be explained by the reduced radiative recombination rate and better separation of quasi -Fermi levels. However, the trade-off between V oc and improvement and Jsc reduction beyond the optimal gap results in an overall decline in device performance.",

Impact of band gap on (a) FF and Efficiency (b) Voc and Jsc. 3.5.Influence of Operating Temperature The operating temperature of PSCs has a significant impact on their efficiency and stability. Understanding these temperature-related effects is crucial for optimizing both the performance and durability of PSCs, particularly in outdoor applications where temperature fluctuations are frequent. This study's influence on temperature range varied from 300 k to 320 k [31] . Figure 6(a , b) illustrates the variation in key performance parameters, including Voc, Jsc, FF, and PCE as a function of temperature . The simulation results reveal that as the operating temperature increases, Jsc, PCE , and FF exhibit an increasing trend [32]. Specifically, the PCE enhancement with rising temperature can be attributed to factors such as alternations in material properties , including band gap, carrier transport concentration, and electron and hole mobilities . These temperature-induced changes align with analytical predictions and highlight the dynamic nature of PSC performance under varying thermal conditions. Interestingly, the decline in V oc with increasing temperature contrasts with the improvements observed in other parameters.",

This reduced Voc can be attributed to an increased density of interfacial defects, leading to higher series resistance and a decrease in carrier diffusion length. Elevated temperature tends to enhance thermal excitation, increasing interface recombination losses and adversely affecting the voltage output. The simulation also demonstrated that PSCs based on the CS2CuBiCl6 (CCBC) absorber layer exhibit promising perform ance at elevated temperatures. At 320 K, the PSC achieves a high PCE of 20.51%, Voc of 0.892 V, J sc of 33.71 mA/cm2, and FF of 68.18%. These results underscore the potential of CCBC -based PSCs for application in environments with moderate temperature variations, as their performance parameters remain robust under such conditions.

Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have garnered remarkable attention as an emerging third-generation solar cell technology. This paper presents an in-depth analysis of lead-free mixed halide double perovskites in the context of their potential uses in solar cell technology. Through the previous studies of various mixed halide double perovskite materials as potential absorber layer materials, it has been observed that Cs 2TiI6-xBrx possesses promising characteristics. In this study, simulations were conducted using SCAPS-1D software to explore all possible combinations for x= 0 to 6. The materials for the Hole Transport Layer (HTL) and Electron Transport Layer (ETL) and absorber layer, along with their optimal thicknesses, are selected to yield the most promising results in terms of open-circuit voltage (V oc), short-circuit current density (J sc), fill factor (FF), and power conversion efficiency. A novel tolerance factor is employed to assess structural stability of perovskites. FTO/Cu 2O/Cs2TiI5Br1/WS2 emerges as the best combination in terms of the efficiency with 19.03% but FTO/Cu2O/Cs2TiI2Br4/WS2 shows good stability with 13.31% efficiency.

I NTRODUCTION Over the decade, solar cells made from materials like CdTe, CIGS, GaInP, and CZTS were outperformed by a new kind of solar cell called Perovskite Solar Cells (PSCs) [1]. These PSCs are made from inorganic-organic halide ABX 3 type structure. It also possess several impressive and distinct photoelectric properties, such as a high absorption coefficient, long carrier diffusion length, high carrier mobility, low recombination rate, and tunable band gaps through chemical modification. [2]. In the past few years, the efficiency in hybrid halide organic- inorganic perovskite solar cells, specifically CH 3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3), has improved quickly, rising from 3.8% in 2009 [3] to 26.1% in 2023 [4]. Despite the rapid increase in the efficiency, there are still a few major challenges hindering the widespread adoption of this technology. One issue is the intrinsic and extrinsic instability of the organic components, and another significant concern is the toxicity of lead. To address these issues, all- inorganic cesium halide perovskites are being explored as alternatives [5]. In these, cesium Cs + is used to replace MA + or FA + in the A-site of the perovskite structure. These are more stable thermodynamically and less prone to moisture absorption. Research by Yang et al. indicates that the high- temperature phase of CsPbBr 3 shows greater thermodynamic stability, as well as intrinsic and extrinsic stability [6]. To make perovskites more stable and lead-free on the B site, A2BIBIIIX6 structures have been introduced.",

Building on this strategy, researchers have successfully synthesized several halide dou- ble perovskites, such as Cs 2AgInCl6 [7] and Cs 2AgSbCl6 [8]. But these new perovskites have excessively large band gaps. This makes them unsuitable for use in single-junction solar cells. Meanwhile, Woodward et. al have developed the first halide double perovskite Cs 2AgBiBr6 which has large band gap and resistance to air and water exposure [9]. After that, the mutation of B 2+ ions in double perovskites has been achieved by incorporationg tetravalent cations resulting in \u201dvacancy- ordered\u201d double perovskites with the general formula A 2BX6. Chen et al. successfully synthesized Cs 2TiBr6, with exper- imental results showing that it possesses a stable bandgap of 1.8eV [5]. The thin-film perovskite solar cells based on Cs2TiBr6 have demonstrated a consistent efficiency of up to 3.3% [10]. Qui et al. conducted a detailed analysis of the band gaps, spectral characteristics, and formation energies of Cs 2Ti(Br1-xYx)6 (where Y represents Cl and I; and x varies from 0 to 1 in increments of 0.25) by utilizing first- principles methods based on Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations [11]. Despite these developments, the challenge of identifying the most effective ionic substitutions for enhanced efficiency and stability remains.

The cross-section for electron capture is measured at 10\u221219 cm\u22122 for Perovskite/ETL and 10\u221218 cm\u22122 for HTL/Perovskite. In contrast, the cross-section for hole capture stands at 10\u221218 cm\u22122 for Perovskite/ETL and 10\u221219 cm\u22122 for HTL/Perovskite respectively. Table I summarizes these parameters. The simulations were conducted under standard operating conditions using solar spectrum AM 1.5G and a temperature of 300K. III. R ESULTS AND DISCUSSION A. J-V Characteristics for different HTLs and varying their thickness The J-V characteristics for seven HTLs - CuSbS 2, CuSCN, Cu2O, CuI, Spiro-OMETAD, MoO 2, and MoS 2 were inves- tigated to assess their impact on cell performance. CuSbS 2 shows the poorest performance, with minimum J sc and V oc. So, it\u2019s not optimal for high-efficiency PSCs. CuSCN, Cu 2O, CuI, Spiro-OMETAD, and MoO2 have similar Jsc as displayed in Fig-2.",

J-V Characteristics for different ETLs and varying their thickness The J-V characteristics of five ETLs, specifically TiO 2, ZnO, CdS, WS 2, and SnO 2, were evaluated to assess their efficacy in PSCs. By performing comparative analysis of the curves, as depicted in Fig-4, it can be seen that there is a lack of substantial variation among the ETLs. Consequently, deter- mining an optimal ETL from the materials poses a challenge. The Y-axis of Fig-5 across all the curves indicates a negligible Fig. 4: J-V characteristics for different ETLs impact of layer thickness of the ETLs on the performance parameters. A closer look in the zoomed-in plot of Fig-5(a), reveals that WS2 shows higher efficiency at a thickness of 0.04 \u00b5m. Additionally, WS2 also surpasses the other ETLs in terms of FF. These observations led to the selection of WS 2 as the preferred ETL material with the thickness of 0.04 \u00b5m. C.

Fig-6(c) indicates that lower Cu 2O acceptor concentrations and higher WS2 donor concentrations show higher J sc. Moreover, as shown in Fig-6(d), FF is more influenced by Cu 2O\u2019s acceptor concentration. So, this study adopts an acceptor concentration of 8.5 \u00d71019 cm\u22123 for Cu 2O and a donor concentration of 5\u00d71018 cm\u22123 for WS2.

(a) Efficiency (b) Open-circuit voltage (c) Short- circuit current density (d) Fill factor In Fig-8(a), an increase in efficiency acn be seen with the increase of absorber layer thickness up to a certain point. After that the efficiency begins to diminish. Likewise, an increase in FF up to a thickness of about 3.2 \u00b5m, followed by a subsequent decrease can be seen from Fig-8(d). On the other hand, the efficiency remains relatively unaffected until a defect density of 10 12 cm\u22123 is reached. Beyond that a significant drop in efficiency occurs (Fig-9(a)). It notably falls from around 29% to 19% as the defect density escalates from 10 12 cm\u22123 to 1015 cm\u22123 . This highlights cell\u2019s susceptibility to higher defect densities in absorber layer. Forthis study, a defect density of 1015 cm\u22123 was selected based on practical considerations and empirical validation. In contrast, the FF\u2019s response to increasing defect densities, as illustrated in Fig-9(d), is less severe. The FF decreases marginally from 89.2% to 88.5% when defect density rises from 10 12 to 10 15 , indicating a relatively resilient behavior of FF against variations in defect density within the specified range.

Performance and stability analysis This paper\u2019s focus on mixed halide double perovskite ma- terials involved a comparative analysis of their efficiency and stability to identify the most suitable absorber material for PSCs. The key findings are summarized in Table II. It can be seen that an increase in the value of x in (Cs2TiI6-xBrx) leads to a reduction in efficiency. The mate- rial Cs 2TiI5Br1 showcased the highest efficiency among the variants tested. However, its stability, when assessed using the improved tolerance factor ( \u03c4) and the associated stability probability P( \u03c4), is significantly lower compared to other materials. On the other hand, materials like Cs 2TiBr6, Cs 2TiI1Br5, and Cs2TiI2Br4, which have lower efficiencies, exhibit higher stability. Notably, Cs2TiI2Br4 achieves a balance between effi- ciency (13.31%) and stability, displaying the highest efficiency among the more stable materials. Therefore, Cs 2TiI2Br4 is identified as a superior absorber material considering both efficiency and stability and emerges as a promising candidate for future research and potential application in perovskite solar cell technology.

However, the presence of toxic lead has caused a concern due to its negative impact on humans and the environment. This has led to an interest in lead-free alternatives. Despite researchers' interest, commercial feasibility has been difficult due to lack of numerical studies to optimize parameters before experimentation. This research presents a study on lead-free CsSnI 3 PSCs using one-dimensional solar capacitance simulation (SCAPS-1D) tool. The initial device consists of TiO 2 as the electron transport layer (ETL) and Spiro-OMeTAD as the hole transport layer (HTL). When the device was calibrated, the results were 13.631% for PCE, 82.459% for FF, 18.637 mA/cm 2 for J sc , and 0.887 V for V oc . Various HTLs and ETLs were used to determine FTO/WS 2 /CsSnI 3 /PEDOT:PSS/Au as the most effective optimized solar cell structure.",

After optimizing the PSC parameters including; the thickness of the ETL, the doping concentration of the ETL, defect density of absorber, ETL/absorber defect density, absorber/HTL defect density, and the metal back contact, the device yielded an optimized PCE of 20.730%, which is 1.52 times higher than the PCE for the unoptimized device. Other parameters for the optimized device are; FF = 80.340%, J sc = 25.315 mA/cm 2 and V oc = 1.019 V. The influence of temperature, shunt, and series resistances on the metric performance of the optimized cell were systematically analyzed. The quantum efficiency, recombination, and generation rate were used to further validate our results. This is a preview of subscription content, log in via an institution to check access.

In line with this, we modeled cesium tin iodide (CsSnI 3 )\u2013based perovskite solar cell (PSC) with titanium (IV) oxide (TiO 2 ) and copper thiocyanate (CuSCN) as the electron and hole transport materials respectively by employing one-dimensional solar cell capacitance simulator (1D-SCAPS). For the CsSnI 3 -based PSC, n-i-p planar configuration was employed and previously published relevant data were used for the simulation. The results obtained for the initially modeled PSC compared well with similar devices in the literature. Based on the established relationship between charge carrier lifetime and power conversion efficiency (PCE) of a solar cell, we varied defect density in the cesium tin iodide (CsSnI 3 ) from 10 13 to 10 17 cm \u22123 and studied its influence on the performance parameters of the modeled CsSnI 3 -based PSC. We find that the diffusion length and lifetime of charge carriers are significantly increased with decreasing defect density of the CsSnI 3 absorber.",

            "text": "deled CsSnI 3 -based PSC. We find that the diffusion length and lifetime of charge carriers are significantly increased with decreasing defect density of the CsSnI 3 absorber. In this study, we report that it is possible to significantly reduce the dominated Shockley\u2013Read\u2013Hall (SRH) high recombination rate occurring in CsSnI 3 perovskite layer even at a low defect density of 10 13 cm \u22123 by using a combination of SnCl 2 and Br \u2212 as additive and dopant respectively for CsSnI 3 enrichment. This strategy ensured a reduced concentration of Sn 4+ vacancy ( V Sn ) in the CsSnI 3 absorber and an improved carrier lifetime beyond 0.05 ns as obtained for the initially modeled CsSnI 3 -based PSC by a magnitude of the order of 10 3 while the diffusion length was improved from 1.1 \u00b5m by a magnitude of the order of 10 2 for the enriched CsSnI 3 -based PSC. For the optimized CsSnI 3 -based PSC, we recorded an open-circuit voltage ( V OC ) of magnitude 1.289 V, short-circuit current density ( J SC ) value 32.60 mA\u2219cm \u22122 , fill factor (FF) 83.56%, and PCE 35.12%.

            "text": "Device Engineering of a Novel Lead-Free Solar Cell Architecture Utilizing Inorganic CsSnCl 3 and CsSnI 3 Perovskite-Based Dual Absorbers for Sustainable Powering of Wireless Networks Topical Collection: Frontiers in Materials Science 2024 Published: 26 November 2024 Volume 54 , pages 944\u2013961, ( 2025 ) Cite this article Save article View saved research Journal of Electronic Materials Aims and scope Submit manuscript Abstract As the Internet of Things (IoT) expands, the demand for reliable and autonomous power sources for small, distributed devices continues to grow. With proper integration, perovskite solar cell (PSC) architecture can ensure that wireless nodes have a continuous power supply, which is critical for the reliable operation of wireless networks, especially in remote or harsh environments. Therefore, this article proposes a novel design of cesium tin iodide (CsSnI 3 ) and cesium tin chloride (CsSnCl 3 )-based dual perovskite absorber composition sandwiched between a titanium dioxide (TiO 2 ) electron transport layer (ETL) and Spiro-OMeTAD hole transport layer (HTL) to form an indium tin oxide (ITO)/TiO 2 /CsSnCl 3 /CsSnI 3 /Spiro-OMeTAD/Ag heterojunction solar cell architecture. The critical device parameters, including absorber layer and carrier transport layer thickness, defect density, temperature, doping concentration, and series and shunt resistance, are thoroughly optimized and evaluated using a solar cell capacitance simulator (SCAPS-1D). Peak power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 24%, short-circuit current ( J SC ) of 28.5 mA/cm 2 , open-circuit voltage ( V OC ) of 0.96 V, and fill-factor ( FF ) of 85.87% under AM 1.5 photo illuminance at a device defect density of 10 15 cm \u22123 are obtained.",

            "text": "28.5 mA/cm 2 , open-circuit voltage ( V OC ) of 0.96 V, and fill-factor ( FF ) of 85.87% under AM 1.5 photo illuminance at a device defect density of 10 15 cm \u22123 are obtained. The proposed dual-absorber composition notably outperforms the mere 12.96% and 9.66% PCE attained with the reported CsSnI 3 - and CsSnCl 3 -based single-absorber PSC counterparts. Moreover, by implementing the proposed CsSnI 3 /CsSnCl 3 dual-absorber composition, improved quantum efficiency (QE) of 90% is achieved across a spectral range of 400\u20131000 nm. The all-inorganic absorber-based PSC composition will reduce reliance on traditional power sources, promoting greener and more sustainable energy-intensive sensors and applications, such as real-time monitoring and data analytics within the network. The proposed PSC, comprising a single module with an area of 100 cm 2 and PCE of 24%, can generate 2.736 W of green power under standard test conditions. Consequently, a solar panel comprising 88 PSCs could support approximately 48 wireless sensor nodes, each consuming 5 W of power.

Despite recent abrupt rise in the efficiency of perovskite solar cells (PSCs), the contact layers maybe limit the efficiency of PSCs. The hole transporting layer (HTL) is an essential layer for reducing the recombination and loosing charges in fabricated devices by avoiding direct contact of gold to perovskite absorber layer in an efficient PSC device. The pristine spiro-OMeTAD, as most widely used HTL, still suffers from poor electrical conductivity, low hole mobility, and low oxidation rate. In this research, the nitrogen doped TiO2(N-TiO2) proposed as a low-cost, efficient, safe replacement for spiro-OMeTAD HTL in PSCs. The variation in the device design key parameters such as the thickness and bulk defect density of perovskite layer, simultaneous modifications of defect density and defect energy level, and acceptor doping concentration in absorber layer are examined with their impact on the photovoltaic characteristic parameters. The effect of an increase in operating temperature from 280 K to 460 K on the performance of CsSnI3-based perovskite devices is also investigated. The standard simulated lead-free CsSnI3\u2013based PSCs with spiro-OMeTAD HTL by SCAPS-1D software revealed the highest power conservation efficiency (PCE) of 23.63%. The CsSnI3-based solar cell with N-TiO2as HTL showed FF (79.65%), VOC(0.98 V), Jsc(34.69 mA/cm2), and efficiency (27.03%) higher than the standard device with conventional spiro-OMeTAD HTL.",

The outcomes of N-TiO2presence as an HTL signify a critical avenue for the possibility of fabricating high PCE CsSnI3-based perovskite devices made of stable, low-cost, efficient, safe, and eco-friendly materials. Physical sciences/Materials science/Materials for energy and catalysis/Solar cells Physical sciences/Materials science/Materials for devices/Electronic devices Physical sciences/Physics/Condensed-matter physics/Surfaces, interfaces and thin films Recently, an increasing number of theoretical studies have been done to design more efficient inorganic lead-free PSC devices with different electron transporting layer (ETL) and hole transporting layer (HTL) in both normal and inverted structures [1\u20138]. However, there is a lot of literature on HTL-free PSCs, insertion of HTL can boost the hole extraction by blocking the electron flow, and minimizing the charges recombination [9,10]. Therefore, the HTL is an essential factor for fabricating an efficient PSC device. The spiro-OMeTAD is the most widely adopted organic HTL in the high efficiency perovskite devices. The pure spiro-OMeTAD has poor electrical conductivity (\\(\\approx {10}^{-8} {Scm}^{-1}\\)), and low hole mobility (\\(\\approx {10}^{-4}{ cm}^{2}{V}^{-1}{s}^{-1}\\)). Moreover, the slow oxidation of spiro-OMeTAD along with its rough surface include pinholes and cracks lead to the necessity of dopants usage or oxidative processes [11]. Although, adding dopants like lithium bis (trifluoromethane) sulfonimide (Li-TFSI) which is hygroscopic readily absorbs water.",

Water causes the degradation of both the organic HTL and the perovskite layer [12]. Recently, extensive experimental and theoretical research has been focused on the substitution of conventional spiro-OMeTAD by other HTLs arising from inexpensive components and easy fabrication methods to improve the stability and efficiency of PSCs in a lower-cost synthesis process [6,9,13]. A typical simulation on CsSnI3PSC devices with different ETLs (including TiO2, ZnO, SnO2, GaN, C60, and PCBM) evaluated a maximum efficiency of 20.2% for the device with a normal configuration of TiO2/CsSnI3/Spiro-OMeTAD [14]. The present study proposed a highly stable, low-cost HTL substitution for conventional spiro-OMeTAD in CsSnI3based PSC devices. Herein, nitrogen doped TiO2(N-TiO2) is introduced as a cost-effective hole transport material in a novel CsSnI3-based PSC configuration. The desirable properties of N-TiO2including good chemical stability, nontoxicity, low-cost, and suitable energy alignment, without relying on oxidation in air, make it a potentially attractive HTL in other PSC devices. The n-type TiO2(n-TiO2) generates by oxygen vacancies (VO), while p-type TiO2usually generates using titanium vacancies (VTi) [15,16]. The N-TiO2is a p-type semiconducting material that was previously synthesized by controlling over the titanium vacancies defects in the TiO2structure using solvothermal and hydrothermal methods, sol-gel method, plasma or ion implantation, direct hydrolysis of organic/inorganic salts, and magnetron sputtering [16\u201321].",

CsSnI 3 and CsSnCl 3 represent promising candidates for environmentally friendly PSCs, offering a compelling combination of affordability, high efficiency, and remarkable thermal stability. In this paper, four proposed PSCs were simulated using CsSnCl 3 and CsSnI 3 , exploring the optoelectrical parameters of zinc oxide thin films deposited by Spray Pyrolysis Deposition (SPD) technique as an electron transfer layer (ETL) and transparent conductive oxide (TCO) on the other hand. Various organic and inorganic hole transfer materials (HTM) have been used, such as CuSCN, Spiro-MeOTAD, P3HT, PEDOT: PSS, CBTS, CuI, Cu 2 O, CuO, NiO, with carbon (C) as the contact metal back. These devices were simulated using SCAPS-1D. With the best performing zinc oxide layer, adjustments were made to the absorption layer thickness and doping density of CsSnCl 3 and CsSnI 3 to improve PSC performances. The use of ZnO in PSC as TCO, in particular ZnO/CsSnCl 3 /Cu 2 O/C and ZnO/CsSnl 3 /Cu 2 O/C, achieved maximum power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of 28.15% and 30.16%, respectively. Finally, ZnO/CsSnI 3 /CsSnCl 3 /Cu 2 O/C dual PSCs were simulated, yielding a PCE of 30.54% with a FF of 89.41%, a V OC of 1.1499 V and a J SC of 29.71 mA/cm 2 .",

Abstract: In this study, a novel systematic analysis was conducted to explore the impact of various parameters, including acceptor density (NA), individual layer thickness, defect density, interface defect density, and the metal electrode work function, on efficiency within the FTO/ZnO/CsSnI3/NiOx/Au perovskite solar cell structure through the SCAPS-1D (Solar Cell Capacitance Simulator in 1 Dimension) simulation. ZnO served as the electron transport layer (ETL), CsSnI3 as the perovskite absorption layer (PAL), and NiOx as the hole transport layer (HTL), all contributing to the optimization of device performance. To achieve the optimal power conversion efficiency (PCE), we determined the ideal PAL acceptor density (NA) to be 2 \u00d7 1019 cm\u22123 and the optimal thicknesses to be 20 nm for the ETL (ZnO), 700 nm for the PAL (CsSnI3), and 10 nm for the HTL (NiOx), with the metal electrode remaining as Au. As a result of the optimization process, efficiency increased from 11.89% to 23.84%. These results are expected to contribute to the performance enhancement of eco-friendly, lead-free inorganic hybrid solar cells with Sn-based perovskite as the PAL.",

            "text": "Title: Impact of Hole Transport Layers in Inorganic Lead-Free B-\u03b3-CsSnI3 Perovskite Solar Cells: A Numerical Analysis. Abstract: Tin-based halide perovskite compounds have attracted enormous interest as effective replacements for the conventional lead halide perovskite solar cells (PCSs). However, achieving high efficiency for tin-based perovskite solar cells is still challenging. Herein, we introduced copper sulfide (CuS) as a hole transport material (HTM) in lead free tin-based B-&gamma;-CsSnI3 PSCs to enhance the photovoltaic (PV) performances. The lead free tin-based CsSnI3 perovskite solar cell structure consisting of CuS/CsSnI3/TiO2/ITO was modeled and the output characteristics were investigated by using the one dimensional solar cell capacitance simulator (SCAPS-1D). The CuS hole transport layer (HTL) with proper band arrangement may notably minimize the recombination of the charge carrier at the back side of the perovskite absorber. Density functional theory (DFT)-extracted physical parameters including the band gap and absorption spectrum of CuS were used in the SCAPS-1D program to analyze the characteristics of the proposed PV device. The PV performance parameters of the proposed device were numerically evaluated by varying the absorber thickness and doping concentration. In this work, the variation of the functional temperature on the cell outputs was also studied. Furthermore, different HTMs were employed to investigate the PV characteristics of the proposed CsSnI3 PSC. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of ~29% was achieved with open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.99 V, a fill factor of ~87%, and short circuit current density (Jsc) of 33.5 mA/cm2 for the optimized device.",
